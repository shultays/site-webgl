<br>You swing at the Sun.  You miss.  The Sun swings.  He hits you with a
<br>575MB disk!  You read the 575MB disk.  It is written in an alien
<br>tongue and cannot be read by your tired Sun-2 eyes.  You throw the
<br>575MB disk at the Sun.  You hit!  The Sun must repair your eyes.  The
<br>Sun reads a scroll.  He hits your 130MB disk!  He has defeated the
<br>130MB disk!  The Sun reads a scroll.  He hits your Ethernet board!  He
<br>has defeated your Ethernet board!  You read a scroll of 'postpone until
<br>Monday at 9 AM'.  Everything goes dark...
